# Neural Net Charity Analysis

For this analysis, we review the likelihood of a charity appropriately allocating the money they receive. The intent is to make sure funds aren't given to charities that spend the bulk of their donations on administrative costs with little going to the intended recipients. We ultimately want to create a model that can predict to at least 75% accuracy. 

The model that we hope will attain that desired accuracy is a neural net. A neural net is a machine learning model that consists of three key components. 

1. An input layer, i.e columns of a csv file
2. A hidden layer with a certain number of neurons
3. An output layer which gives our predictions.
